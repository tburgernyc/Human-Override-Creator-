# Human Override Creator - Optimal Script Template

To ensure the "Analyze Script" requires the least amount of correction and generates the highest quality production manifest, follow this formatting guide.

## 1. Concept Module (Optional but Recommended)
Start with a high-level summary to help the AI understand the tone and scope.

**Logline:** [One sentence summary of the video]
**Concept:** [Brief description of the visual style and themes]

---

## 2. Character List
Listing characters explicitly helps the AI extract names, genders, and personalities for voice assignment.

**Characters:**
*   **[Character Name]:** [Gender] - [Brief description of personality and appearance]
*   **[Character Name]:** [Gender] - [Brief description]

---

## 3. Scenes
Use the `[Scene: ...]` header format. This is the most critical part for accurate scene extraction.

### [Scene: Location/Setting - Time of Day]
**Visual:** [Detailed description of what we see. This becomes the image generation prompt.]
**Audio:** [Description of sound effects or music mood, e.g., "Upbeat synthwave music"]

**[Character Name]:**
[Dialogue line. The AI will assign the voice and lip-sync to this.]

**[Character Name]:**
[Dialogue line.]

## Example Script

**Logline:** A lone hacker infiltrates a digital fortress to recover a lost memory.
**Concept:** Cyberpunk noir, high contrast neon, rain-slicked streets.

**Characters:**
*   **Kael:** Male - A weary cyber-detective with a bionic arm.
*   **Aria:** Female - A fugitive AI manifested as a hologram.

### [Scene: Neon Alleyway - Night]
**Visual:** A dark, rain-drenched alleyway in Neo-Tokyo. Neon signs reflect in puddles. Steam rises from vents. Kael stands in the shadows, his bionic arm glowing faintly red.
**Audio:** Distant sirens, heavy rain, melancholic jazz saxophone.

**Kael:**
It's been three days since the signal went dark. I'm starting to think she doesn't want to be found.

**Aria:**
(Voiceover/Hologram)
I'm not lost, Kael. I'm hiding.

### [Scene: The Data Vault - Interior]
**Visual:** A massive server room with towering blue data stacks. The floor is mirrored glass. Kael is hacking into a terminal.
**Audio:** High-tension electronic hum, rapid typing sounds.

**Kael:**
Found you. Protocol Override initiated.

**Aria:**
Be careful. The firewall... it's alive.
